# Work-Day-Scheduler

I got the colors to work in a relatively fast period of time. the hardest part for me is getting the inputs to store to local storage and staying on the page. I also couldn't get the previous enteries to go away. It was kind of annoying. I had to turn the autocomplete feature off on the forms to stop the dropdown. 

I really wanted to use the querySelectorAll to get all of the elements that were using that specific id. That ended up being way harder than it originally seemed. I also wanted to add the input values to the local storage based on where the user clicked. I tried using the event.taget method in multiple different ways but nothing worked. I ended up taking the longer route but at least it was functional in the end.

When I go back to this code, I am going to work on reducing the amount of code in different ways.
